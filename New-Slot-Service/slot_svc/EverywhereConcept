Under the IoT is "everything"

Most of the "features" are self-describing, amd are scale-free in their own right
Metadata for describing the "thing" ( the underlying fabric is immediately identifiable as some "thing" and the "awareness" is developed from there )
Awareness of "state" ( the "thing" is always "doing stuff" and "affecting its own state"; the "device" "knows" the "was", "is" nd "will be" of "state"; the rest of "the world" instantly "knows" what those states are and their "flow"; this "system-wide" knowledge is maintained such that is not only optimizes the "housekeeping" but continuously knows what any combinations of "groups" "are", "were" and "will be" as well as "groups" that "can be"; the discovery of these "emergent" groups is continuous
Connectedness ( going-in connections and those purposefully created ) are supported as part of the fabric, and any possible / logical new connections are discovered and / or created whenever appropriate; connections live forever for analytics, but are "non-existent" at any time for any length of time; they just eternally "exist" and are used as part of any "emergence" ( new connections ) and all connections can be resurrected at any time without the request of any element; these "auto-resurrections" create "devices" that are truly autonomous ( they have a life of their own )
Scale ( there are no limits )
Goal Definition ( at the "birth" of a "device", it has predefined "intended outcomes", "stuff to accomplish" within a specific ( min / max / desired ) time" )
Goal Discovery or Creation ( things that "should" be done based on "emerging awareness" )
Task Definition ( one of any number of "things to do" known to be required to meet a "goal" ( textbook definition that expands to "mean" more within the system and also forms possible connectedness between any "device" )
Task Combine ( any "combine" activity is both discovered and defined ( how can a task "interact with" another task ); discovered and defined combinations and interactions become part of the "graph" and any edge is reinforced continuously; any "edge" becomes a "graph" ( infinitely recursive ) and any "graph" can have one or more "outer edges" allowing the edge (arc ) to become a vertex ( node ); arcs are directional or directionless" )

Goal Combine

Context in everything

Underlying graphs ( component that primarily exists ( don't reinvent any wheel, but use the "what we are accomplishing" to influence any "basic technology component"

Transparent security ( again, start with ( and leverage ) existing, but this is where our uniqueness makes our "security" truly secure

Minimal bandwidth ( awareness of state leads to little or no required communication )

Communication "Meaning" ( all communication of the exact same content means something in context and therefore without that context, the communication is "meaningless" and without the context ( including contextual keys that become part of the embedded security ) is a simple basic "building block" that initially means nothing but can mean something at any time in teh future ( at any time ); the "bits of communication" can be connected at any time ro any legnth of time and the connections themselves have meaning

"Rut" ID / Cohesiveness ( frequency of traversal has meaning or create meaning as well as contributing to what things can become )

Discovery ( anything can be discovered )
Pattern Detection
Global Store ( all "data" exists and is fully accessible any time by any "thing" ( and the "system" ); it never goes away; it is always stored in formats that can never be "hacked" as it is only meaningul in combineationi and in context to have any usefulness
Auto-partition ( storage optimization / distributed store; and the location of store has impaled meaning )
Secure store ( only the "things" that create, use or alter even know what is there )


No limit on # of devices; types of devices
Classification of types of devices
Type attributes
Predefined interrelationships ( everything that can be known about them; infinite interconnections are discovered as patterns within existing and newly-defined relationships )

Seamless Transport ( standards-based communication @ device level so messages @ purpose level do not have to deal with any hardware / network specifications; they just leverage a secure channel ( we have something that adds unique interaction ( with no need to know how the connection does its thing under the covers ) and this allows devices to pretty much use a few "openings" ( ver few needed ) for instant dialog
This makes the many to many communication free of anything but device to device interaction
Secure, only when needed, no overhead, as simple as a phone conversation, no restrictions on what can be said or limits on the understanding of what is being said
No "common language" required ( automatic translations, based on "language metadata" )

Visual ingest ( continuous input of video, limitless store, "smart store" that builds "what could it be" graphs to detect any possible object(s) within the visual space
Not just digital / defined / M2M communication, but voice
Instant voice recognition and conversion to digital ( man-machine "oneness" )

Everything is kept
Everything is connected
Connections are discovered and create new connections
"Evolving Connections"

Agents tasked to "carry out" functions ( if a D2D "relationship" requires certain 'shared awareness" ( for example ) the Agent is that component
They are agents in the general sense and they automatically crowd-source while performing their "primary role" and achieve their "primary objectives"

"System" description @ highest level

Purposed Device "does its thing" and the "system" makes the "results" optimal
All devices are independent
All devices are part of emerging "whole" ( any number of them )
A "whole" is a "composite" device and that "creation" can both be purposeful / pre-defined as a desired / intended entity or it can be a created only by "connected discovery"

Devices and Connections
Affected "things"
Affecting "thing"
( Something affects something else )
Everything else is derived from that "event"

The "micro service" is the "device"

"Hardware" is external product that has the "computer" within that makes it eligible to be one to many "device"

A "device" is software-based and "lives" in the "real world"; it has no "specific home", just "places" it has lived; can "live", will live, should live; "living places" have predefined and discovered interrelationships that create evolving connectedness ( a 'device" "being at" a "place" has implied ( already known ) awareness, and that awareness grows over time )

At its "core", "Everything" mimics "everything" and creates the fabric ( and is the fabric ) by which all "things" become a part of everything"
Not only is everything connected ( that's IoT ) but everything "does its thing" without being aware of the "inherent interactions" that are the fabric
